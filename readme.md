# Towards Freedom Solver
##General

##TO DO
1. Add a description to this Readme
1. Use a DB to save states
1. Allow restart from a previous DB
1. Use multithreading: each thread will take  state and create all possible moves out of it
1. When comparing board states, the moves do not have to be identical . It is enough that shapes of the same size are kept in similar places (e.g. that a 1x1 shape is located in the same  square in both
board states).
